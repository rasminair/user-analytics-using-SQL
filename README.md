# Instagram user analytics project using SQL
Instagram remains one of the world’s most influential social platforms, generating vast amounts of user interaction every second. This SQL-based analysis project explores those interactions to uncover meaningful patterns in user engagement and behavior. By decoding how users interact with content and with each other, these insights can support:

<ul><li>Product teams in designing features that improve user experience</li>

<li>Marketing teams in crafting high-impact, data-driven campaigns</li>

<li>Investors and stakeholders in evaluating platform growth and engagement trends</li></ul>

This project demonstrates how SQL can transform raw social data into actionable intelligence.
